<h1>Anna Truong </h1>
<p>Hello! 👋🏻 a former Software Engineer now pivoting into Data Analytics.<br><br>
My journey into tech began while working as an Account Manager at a marketing agency, where I started automating manual processes to improve efficiency. That curiosity turned into a career in software development, where I focused on backend engineering, building data warehouses, developing tailored business applications, and deploying solutions on Google Cloud Platform with strong CI/CD practices.<br><br>

After some time in engineering, I'm now channeling my analytical mindset and technical skills into the world of data. I'm currently deepening my expertise through hands-on courses in data analysis, and working on projects that blend data storytelling with real-world insights.<br><br>

I'm passionate about uncovering meaningful patterns in data, and I'm excited to contribute to data-driven decision making in my next role.<br><br>
