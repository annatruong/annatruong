<h1>Anna Truong </h1>
<p>Hello! 👋🏻 I'm Anna - a Back-end Engineer.<br><br>
My coding journey began when I was working as an Account Manager at a marketing agency a few years back. Whilst finding ways to improve productivity, I ventured into automating mundane tasks, inadvertently igniting my passion for technology. At my current workplace, I've been focusing on building resilient data warehouses and developing business tailored reporting apps. Additionally, I oversee the deployment of these apps on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), ensuring robust CI/CD pipelines to streamline our development workflows.<br><br>
I'm currently building my front-end knowledge through working on personal projects in my spare time. I'm currently working on an app that allows users to record the books they've read and the app will provide a dashboard that contains an analysis of the user's reading trends.<br><br>
