<h1>Anna Truong </h1>
<p>Hello! 👋🏻 I'm Anna - a Back-End and DevOps Engineer.<br><br>
My coding journey began when I was working as an Account Manager at a marketing agency a few years back. Whilst finding ways to improve productivity, I ventured into automating mundane tasks, inadvertently igniting my passion for technology. At my current workplace, I've been focusing on building resilient data warehouses and developing business tailored reporting apps. Additionally, I oversee the deployment of these apps on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), prioritising the establishment of robust CI/CD pipelines to streamline our development workflows.<br><br>
I'm currently learning C++ and working on small random game projects in my spare time, with the goal to develop my knowledge on game development 👾
